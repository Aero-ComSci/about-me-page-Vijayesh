            <p>My name is Vijayeshnanda Vasanthakumar, and I am a freshman at Emerald High School. My current
                course load is Advanced Algebra II, English 1, Biology, Spanish 2, Computer Science Essentials, 
                Freshman PE, and Contemporary Health. I am the president of the Astrophysics of the Astrophysics 
                Club, Secretary of the Science Olympiad Club, and Team Manager of the VEX Robotics Club. I am 
                also an active member of the Speech and Debate Club. I volunteer at the Dublin Library as a Teen
                Volunteer, where I supervise Library Events, and TAG Member, where I work with other people in 
                order to come up with new events in library (volunteered for 32.5 hours). I also volunteer at the 
                EETHAL Foundation as a Young Translator, where I translate kids stories from English to Tamil so 
                that kids in India can connect with their mother language (volunteered for 18 hours). I am a drummer
                in the Young American Patriots Fife and Drum Corps, where I have participated in many parades and 
                ceremonies (19.25 hours of community service). I am learning Precalculus from Brigham Young University
                and Art of Problem Solving, and I am learning High School English from the Gaussian Academy.

            <p>My presonal career goal is to be a physicist. I am mostly interested in astrophysics, as I love
                space and want to know more about how the universe formed. I have many theoretical questions, like 
                what is on the other side of a black hole, how wormholes can be formed, and if the timeline is 
                fixed or fluid. I want to work for NASA or any other space center as an astrophysicist. My secondary
                job option would be a job in Computer Science. I love creating applications using Python, and I have 
                recently started to create websites with HTML/CSS and Javascript. So my secondary personal career goal
                is either a web developer or game developer, since I enjoy coding games that are fun for teenagers. Because
                of both career goals, I took CSE in order to learn more abut coding and scrum/agile, and I'vve learnt a lot
                from this class. However, I need to make bigger and better projects and win science fairs if I want to get
                into a top college for astrophsyics and computer science such as Caltech, MIT, UC Berkeley, or UCLA. I hope
                to get a bachelor's of science degree in both astrophysics and computer science, and then a master's degree
                in astrophysics.

            <p>Through my experiences working with other people, I have learned to be cooperative with other 
                people by listening to what they say. I have also learned to break up small fights within my peers, 
                as I feel like that is unnecessary and I try to make a compromise for both parties. I am also very 
                patient, as I am very open to other people's opinions. Due to my debate experience, I have learned 
                how to communicate effectively and assertively, and how to research topics in general. I can summarize
                events due to my attentiveness to events, and take notes on these events effectively.
