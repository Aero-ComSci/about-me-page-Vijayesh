                and they can either guess a letter or guess the word entirely. If the player gets it right, the
                clue updates itself to add the letter, but the user loses a life if they get it incorrectly. The 
                game ends when the player guesses the word correctly, or when they use all 9 of their lives.
            </th>
            <th>This game would work much better with an actual hangman gui, but that's hard to code in python so
                I scrapped that. Another feature I could've added was a list of guessed letters.

                want it, and how many ketchup packets. At the end, the application prints out the total cost of the order.
            </th>
            <th>This application is not case sensitive, so this means that capitalization doesn't matter due to the code 
                changing every input to lowercase. The user can also change their order at the end of the application if 
                they want to, but they have to start all the way from the beginning.

                to catch a coin. After the coin is collected, the coin moves to a random place on the screen, and this 
                continues for 1 minute. After that, the final score is provided.

                left and right. As the game progresses, the more and more eggs appear quickly on the screen. This means that the 
                difficulty has increased. The game ends when the user drops three of the eggs.

                battle the computer's chosen pokemon. The user and computer each get to choose from four moves to use, and the game ends 
                when one pokemon's hp becomes zero. Each pokemon has its own unique attack, defense, and hp statistic.
            </th>
            <th>Ok, so there are a lot things that can be improved in this code (that my friends and I are working on for fun). We need to 
                make a better damage equation that actually incorporates both the attack and defense, not just attack, let the moves have
                their own type and damage output instead of using the pokemon's type for the move, and add an actual gui to this game. One good
                feature I have is the delay print, which makes everything print slowly just like the original Pokemon games.
